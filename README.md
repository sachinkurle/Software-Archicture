# Software-Architecture
Software architecture is an art like any other art. I feel it has broadly 2 dimensions to it.

1 - Your think pattern go beyond obivious and dont follow any rules, standards or goverence as if poet writes poems :) These think patterns usually leads to new language, design, software paradigms and methodologies

2 - Your think pattern reamins in boundaries and follows existing standard, rules but try enhance or extend the capabilites. Simple real world example could be bulidng bridge. This patterns leads to new frameowrks/features/extenstions for given domain like mobile or data or UI etc

This repository will make efforts to work on both dimensions along any general topics on software architecture
