# Software-Architecture
Software architecture is an art like any other art. I feel it has broadly 2 dimensions to it.

1 - Think patterns go beyond obivious and dont follow any rules, standards or goverence as if poet writes poems :) These think patterns usually leads to new language, design, software paradigms and methodologies

2 - Think patterns reamins in boundaries, focues on given problem and follows existing standard, rules. Simple real world example could be bulidng bridge. This patterns leads to new frameowrks/features/extenstions/plugins/architecure for given business problem for given interface like web, mobile for given layers like, serivce, data, UI etc 

This repository will make efforts to get insight on both dimensions along any general topics on software architecture with code or/and design examples
