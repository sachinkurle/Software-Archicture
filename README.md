# Software-Architecture
Software architecture is an art like any other art. I feel tt has 2 dimensions to it. 
1 - Your think pattern go beyond obivious and dont follow any rules, standards or goverence as if poet writes poems :) These think patterns usually leads to new language, design, software paradimes and methodologies
2 - Your think pattern reamins in boundaries and follows existing standard, rules but try enhance or extend the capabilites. Simple real world example could be bulidng bridge. This patterns leads new frameowrks for given domain like mobile or data or UI

This repository will make efforts to work on both dimensions along any general topics on software architecture
